## TL;DR

Keep PRs small and focused, write a clear description, automate the boring checks, and talk to your teammates like humans. Everything below makes that easier.

## Why code reviews matter (without the fluff)

Love them or hate them, reviews catch bugs you didn't see and keep the bar high. On today's platforms‚ÄîGitHub PRs and GitLab MRs‚Äîthis is simply how teams ship.

A review isn't paperwork. It's a teammate sanity‚Äëchecking your change:

- **Correctness & safety**: does it do the right thing without side effects?
- **Standards**: does it match how we name, test, log, and structure code?
- **Shared context**: does the team understand the "why," not just the "what"?
- **Learning**: good reviews spread patterns, shortcuts, and gotchas.

That's the value: fewer regressions, more consistent code, and a team that stays on the same page.

## How we actually run reviews

Different teams wire this differently, but the general flow is the same:

1. **Branch off** ‚Äî `git switch -c feat/billing-proration`
2. **Self‚Äëreview first** ‚Äî skim your own diff; delete debug prints and dead code; make tests reflect reality.
3. **Open the PR/MR** ‚Äî signal it's ready for eyes.
4. **Add real context** ‚Äî clear title, short "why", how to test, related ticket, screenshots/logs if helpful.
5. **Let CI do the grunt work** ‚Äî fast checks (unit, lint, types, build) before humans read it.
6. **Review** ‚Äî 1‚Äì2 peers ask questions, suggest changes, approve or request updates.
7. **Iterate** ‚Äî push fixes, resolve threads, repeat.
8. **Merge (and deploy)** ‚Äî once green and approved, merge; your pipeline can ship it or you push the button.

Yes, under deadlines this can feel slow. Good habits + the right tools make it fast.

## Common pitfalls (and better moves)

### 1) Rubber‚Äëstamping ("looks fine üëç")

Skimming now adds a pay‚Äëlater tax. Superficial approvals miss architectural edge cases, security foot‚Äëguns, and regressions.

**Do instead**: block 15‚Äì20 minutes, scan commit‚Äëby‚Äëcommit, and focus on risky files (auth, billing, migrations).

### 2) Oversized PRs

Huge diffs are hard to review well. Attention drops; issues slip.

**Rule of thumb**: keep diffs small enough to review over one coffee (aim ‚â§ 400 LOC of meaningful change). If it's getting big, split by concern: schema ‚Üí PR A, business logic ‚Üí PR B, UI ‚Üí PR C.

### 3) Mystery PRs (no context)

A vague title and blank description force reviewers to play detective. Those PRs sit idle or get shallow feedback.

**Include the basics**:

- **Why**: the problem or user story
- **What changed**: one‚Äëparagraph summary
- **How to test**: exact steps or commands
- **Risk/roll‚Äëback**: migrations, perf hotspots, compat notes
- **Screenshots/logs**: before/after for UI or critical flows

### 4) Taking feedback personally

Reviews are about the code, not the coder. Defensiveness stalls progress; harsh comments shut people down.

**Better pattern**: assume good intent. As a reviewer, suggest, don't snipe: "Have you considered caching this?" beats "This is wrong." As an author, ask clarifying questions and explain trade‚Äëoffs briefly.

### 5) Bikeshedding style (quotes, spaces, commas)

Humans debating formatting is a waste of focus.

**Let tools handle it**: run ESLint (JS/TS), Ruff (Python), and Prettier in CI. Spend review time on logic, structure, perf, and security.

## Seven habits that make reviews fast (and useful)

### 1) Keep PRs short and focused

Small, single‚Äëpurpose PRs get feedback faster and with more signal. If you're touching many areas, consider feature flags and incremental PRs.

### 2) Write a clear description

Answer three things: what changed, why now, how to test. If anything is risky, say so.

### 3) Use a PR template

A template enforces the basics when energy is low. (Template below.)

### 4) Ask for specific feedback

Call out where you want eyes: "Please focus on the caching logic in cache.ts" or "Security review appreciated on the JWT handling."

### 5) Be polite and constructive

Praise something good, then suggest improvements. It costs nothing and keeps momentum.

### 6) Review early, review often

Open a Draft PR to get direction checks on big changes. Don't build in a bunker.

### 7) Automate the boring stuff

CI should run tests, types, linters, formatters, and basic static analysis on every PR. Humans focus on trade‚Äëoffs; machines catch nits.

## Copy‚Äëpaste templates

### Pull request template

```
### Why
Invoices were double-charging when proration crossed months (JIRA-1234).

### What changed
Refactored proration calc to cap at month boundary; added guard on negative deltas.

### How to test
1) Seed plan A ‚Üí plan B mid-month
2) Trigger invoice preview API
3) Expect delta ‚â§ 1 month and no negatives

### Risk/Rollback
One migration on `invoice_items`; safe to roll back.

### Notes for reviewers
Focus on `proration.ts` (caching + rounding).
```

### Reviewer checklist

- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Names/abstractions make sense
- [ ] Edge cases covered (nil/undefined, timezones, empty states)
- [ ] Security: input validation, authZ, secrets
- [ ] Performance: N+1 queries, unbounded loops, cache keys
- [ ] Migrations: idempotent, reversible
- [ ] Logs/metrics: actionable, not noisy

### Team policy (lightweight)

```yaml
reviews:
  max_pr_size_loc: 400
  required_checks: [lint, typecheck, unit]
  approvals: 1
  stale_after_days: 5
  auto_assign_reviewers: true
```

## Handy practices that compound over time

- **Commit smaller, more often**. `git add -p` helps keep diffs tight.
- **Name your branches well**. `fix/‚Ä¶`, `feat/‚Ä¶`, `chore/‚Ä¶` beats `syd/test`.
- **Use screenshots for UI**. Before/after GIFs save a thousand words.
- **Leave breadcrumbs**. If something is tricky, drop a one‚Äëliner comment in code.
- **Set a merge SLO**. e.g., "first response < 24h; merge or clear path < 3 days."

## Wrap‚Äëup

Keep PRs small, write a clear description, automate the boring checks, and be kind in reviews. Do that, and you'll ship faster with fewer surprises‚Äîand your team will actually like the process.
