## Axolo Earns SOC 2 Type II Certification ðŸŽ‰

We're thrilled to announce that **Axolo is now SOC 2 Type II certified** â€” a big step forward in our mission to keep your data safe and secure.

This certification, overseen by the AICPA, is a trusted benchmark for how well a company protects customer information. Over the past few months, an independent auditor took a deep dive into our systems, reviewing everything from our internal processes to how we handle source code collaboration. The result? Axolo passed with flying colors, proving our commitment to top-tier security and reliability.
