Seamless collaboration is more crucial than ever. One way to achieve this is through GitHub pull request Microsoft Teams integration. This integration not only streamlines your code review process but also enhances team communication. In this article, we'll explore the top solutions that offer GitHub PR integration with Microsoft Teams, focusing on features, ease of setup, and overall value.

Here are 3 different types of GitHub pull request Microsoft Teams integration that we are going to study in this article:

## **1. Axolo**

When it comes to fostering collaboration across your engineering team, Axolo stands out as more than just another pull request notification bot. Designed to facilitate efficient code reviews, Axolo offers a comprehensive suite of features tailored for Microsoft Teams.

### üòç What we like:

Axolo creates a temporary Microsoft Teams channel for every GitHub pull request, inviting reviewers and assignees to join. This channel serves as a hub for all relevant notifications, including code comments, GitHub actions, and deployments. Once the pull request is closed or merged, the channel is automatically archived, ensuring a clutter-free workspace.

  />
</div>

Axolo is currently in private early-access for Microsoft Teams at the moment. Tell us <a onClick={() => { window.$crisp.push(['do', 'chat:open']); window.$crisp.push(["do", "message:send", ["text", "Hey, I want to try the Axolo Microsoft teams integration!"]]) }}>here</a> if you would like to take part in the early-access with your email and we will get back to you.

<div className="flex justify-center">
  <button
    onClick={() => {
      window.$crisp.push(["do", "chat:open"])
      window.$crisp.push([
        "do",
        "message:send",
        ["text", "Hey, I want to try the Axolo Microsoft teams integration!"],
      ])
    }}

### Axolo's Technical Edge: How It Integrates with Microsoft Teams

When it comes to GitHub pull request Microsoft Teams integration, Axolo goes beyond the basics to offer a technically robust solution. Here's a closer look at the technical aspects that set Axolo apart:

#### API Functionalities

Axolo leverages Microsoft Teams' and GitHub's APIs to create a seamless integration. This allows for real-time synchronization between your GitHub repositories and Microsoft Teams channels, ensuring that all stakeholders are on the same page.

#### Security Features

Security is a top priority for Axolo. The integration is built with enterprise-level security protocols, including OAuth for authentication and end-to-end encryption, to protect your code and communications.

#### Handling GitHub Actions and Checks

One of Axolo's standout features is its ability to handle GitHub actions and checks efficiently. Whenever a GitHub action is triggered or a code check is completed, Axolo sends a notification to the relevant Microsoft Teams channel. This ensures that your team can react promptly to any changes, making the code review process faster and more efficient.

## **2. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/integrations/microsoft-teams">Official GitHub Microsoft integrations</a>.**

For those already familiar with GitHub's native integration with Microsoft Teams, you'll find that it offers a robust set of features designed to enhance team communication and collaboration.

### üòç What we like:

- Direct code display in Teams enhances real-time collaboration.
- High customization options let you tailor notifications to your needs, and the well-documented integration simplifies this process.
- Direct support from the GitHub team adds an extra layer of reliability.

### ü§î What we don't like:

- Initial setup can be time-consuming and somewhat confusing.
- Manual subscription to each repository is required, which can be cumbersome for teams managing multiple repositories.
- No collaborative feature in this integration, it's a notification bot.

### Main Features of the Official GitHub Microsoft Teams Integration

#### Stay Updated on the Latest in One Repository Channel

By using the @github subscribe [repository name] command within Microsoft Teams, you can receive real-time updates on various GitHub activities such as new commits, pull requests, issues, status updates, comments, and code reviews. This eliminates the need for constant context-switching between GitHub and Microsoft Teams, allowing you to focus more on your work.

#### Move from Conversation to Next Steps

One of the standout features is the ability to turn Microsoft Teams discussions into actionable GitHub tasks. With threading support for pull request and issue notifications, the context is retained, making collaboration more efficient. Supported actions include opening a new issue, closing and reopening existing issues, and commenting on issues and pull requests.

#### Unfurl GitHub Links

When you share GitHub links in your Microsoft Teams channel, detailed previews are automatically generated. This feature supports a variety of GitHub activities and properties, including pull requests, issues, comments, code snippets, repositories, and even accounts or organizations.
Since this is an official integration there are cool features you will not see in another type of reminder bots, such as displaying code directly in Teams.

## **3. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://zapier.com/apps/github/integrations/microsoft-teams">Zapier</a>**

### üòç What we like:

It's easy to set up custom workflow for individuals or for a specific channel, especially if you already have Zapier.

### ü§î What we don't like:

The lack of GitHub actions and deployments notifications.
Also the integration are basic and probably won't be enough to fit all your needs.

## Conclusion

We've explored three distinct GitHub and Microsoft Teams integrations, each offering unique approaches to streamlining pull requests and enhancing team engagement. Broadly, these integrations fall into two categories:

### 1. Event-Driven Notification Bots:

Solutions like Zapier and the official GitHub Teams integration primarily serve as notification bots, alerting you or a designated channel when a pull request is up for review.

### 2. Comprehensive Collaboration Platforms:

Axolo leads the pack here. Beyond just notifications, Axolo establishes dedicated channels for each pull request, facilitating focused discussions and quicker resolutions during code reviews.

Companies leveraging Axolo have reported more efficient collaboration and faster pull request closures. Interested?
